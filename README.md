# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study
On this Repository, i will perform the [Google Data Analytics Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) (a case study from the Google Data Analytics course).

## Introduction
In this case study, i will perform tasks of a junior data analyst for a fictional company named Cyclistic.

## Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company, which features more that 5800 bikes in 600 different stations across Chicago.
The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Something innovative about this company, is the offer of reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes, making bike-share more
inclusive to people with disabilities. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. 
Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, they believe that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

So the goal is clear: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Task and Scenario
So working as a junior data analyst for the marketing analytics team, my task is to understand how casual riders and annual members
use Cyclistic bikes differently. After evaluating the data, the team will make recommendations on how to convert casual riders into annual members.
